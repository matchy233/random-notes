When she said she loved me her mouth was a straight line,<br>
She told me that I was taking up too much of her time<br>
Last week she started sleeping at her mother's place<br>
She told me that she shouldn't have let me get so attached to her;<br>
that this whole thing was a mistake, but...<br>
How can it be a mistake that i don't have to wash my hands after I touched her?<br>
Love is not a mistake, and it's killing me that she can run away from this and I just can't,<br>
I can't — I can't go out and find someone new because I always think of her,<br>
Usually, when I obsess over things, I see germs sneaking into my skin.<br>
I see myself crushed by an endless succession of cars...<br>
And she was the first beautiful thing I ever got stuck on.<br>
I want to wake up every morning, thinking about the way she holds her steering wheel...<br>
How she turns shower knobs like she's opening a safe.<br>
How she blows out candles—<br>
blows out candles—<br>
blows out candles—<br>
blows out candles—<br>
blows out candles—<br>
blows out...<br>
Now, I just think about who else is kissing her,<br>
I can't breathe because he only kisses her once — he doesn't care if it is perfect<br>
I want her back, so bad...<br>
I leave the door unlocked.<br>
I leave the lights on.<br>
