> I hurt myself today<br>
> To see if I still feel<br>
> I focus on the pain<br>
> The only thing that's real<br><br>
>The needle tears a hole<br>
>The old familiar sting<br>
>Try to kill it all away<br>
>But I remember everything<br><br>
>What have I become?<br>
>My sweetest friend<br>
>Everyone I know goes away<br>
>In the end<br><br>
>And you could have it all<br>
>My empire of dirt<br>
>I will let you down<br>
>I will make you hurt<br><br>
>I wear this crown of thorns<br>
>Upon my liar's chair<br>
>Full of broken thoughts<br>
>I cannot repair<br><br>
>Beneath the stains of time<br>
>The feelings disappear<br>
>You are someone else<br>
>I'm still right here
