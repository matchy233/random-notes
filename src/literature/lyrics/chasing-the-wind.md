# Chasing the Wind

I see love is real,<br/>
it stares me straight in the eyes and tells me how to feel, inside.<br/>
You looked into my heart<br/>
and you saw that it was true so tell me where to start this love, this love.<br/>
I'm running fast.<br/>
I'm trying to reach You.<br/>
I'm pushing all the things that are in my way.<br/>
**And they don't really know what You mean to me.**<br/>
**No I'm not just chasing the wind**.<br/><br/>
The storm is ragin' in.<br/>
This is not as simple as it was back when.<br/>
When I was close to You and everything made sense.<br/>
Now I am running back again.<br/>
I am.<br/>
Yes, I am.<br/>
I am.<br/>
I'm running fast.<br/>
I'm trying to reach You.<br/>
I'm pushing all the things that are in my way.<br/>
And they don't really know what You mean to me.<br/>
No I'm not just chasing the wind.<br/><br/>
And how did I ever get here?<br/>
Where do I stop?<br/>
Where do I end?<br/>
But here I am and here I'll stay.<br/>
Why do I fall short of love?<br/>
Chasing things that don't fill me up.<br/>
But you are love, and you are true.<br/><br/>
I'm running fast.<br/>
I'm trying to reach You.<br/>
I'm pushing all the things that are in my way.<br/>
And they don't really know what You mean to me.<br/>
No I'm not just chasing the wind.<br/>
I'm running fast.<br/>
I'm trying to reach You.<br/>
I'm pushing all the things that are in my way.<br/>
And they don't really know what You mean to me.<br/>
No I'm not just chasing the wind.<br/>
