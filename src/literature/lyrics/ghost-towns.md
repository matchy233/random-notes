I've got no need for open roads<br>
'Cause all I own fits on my back<br>
I see the world from rusted trains<br>
And always know I won't be back<br><br>
'Cause all my life is wrapped up in today<br>
No past or future here<br>
If I find my name's no good<br>
I just fall out of line<br><br>
But I miss you<br>
But there's comin' home<br>
There's no comin' home<br>
With a name like mine<br>
I still think of you<br>
But everyone knows<br>
Yeah everyone knows<br>
If you care, let it go<br><br>
I've seen more places than I can name<br>
And over time they all start to look the same<br>
But it ain't that truth we chase<br>
No, it's the promise of a better place<br><br>
**But all this time, I been chasin' down a lie**<br>
**And I know it for what it is**<br>
**But it beats the alternatives**<br>
**So I'll take the lie**<br><br>
I still miss you<br>
There's no goin' home<br>
There's no goin' home<br>
With a name like mine<br>
I still dream of you<br>
But everyone knows<br>
Yeah everyone knows<br>
If you can, let it go<br>
