# Citation generation

## Genearte `.bib`

Use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to manage references and export them as `.bib` files. Note that he bibliography can only be generated at the collection level.

1. Right click on the collection to export
2. Choose `Export Collection`
3. Choose `BibTeX` or `BibLaTeX` as the export format
4. Save the file

## Generate copy-pasteable citation

Use [mybib](https://www.mybib.com/tools/ieee-citation-generator) to generate IEEE citation (it can also generate other styles but I basically hate everthing else except IEEE).
